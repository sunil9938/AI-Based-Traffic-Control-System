# AI-Based-Traffic-Control-System
AI Traffic Control System is a smart traffic management solution that uses computer vision to detect and count vehicles on each road lane. It analyzes traffic density in real time and dynamically adjusts signal timings to reduce congestion and improve traffic flow efficiently.

## ✨ Features

- 🚗 **Vehicle Detection & Counting** using OpenCV and deep learning.
- 📊 **Real-time Traffic Density Analysis** for each road lane.
- 🚦 **Dynamic Signal Control** based on lane-wise vehicle load.
- 🧠 **AI Decision Engine** to prioritize heavily congested roads.
- 📈 **Traffic Visualization Dashboard** (optional using Streamlit or web app).
- 🗃️ Dataset compatible / can use live camera feed or pre-recorded videos.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- YOLO / MobileNet / Haar Cascades (for vehicle detection)
- NumPy, Pandas
- Optional: Flask / Streamlit (for UI)
- Optional: TensorFlow / PyTorch (for custom models)

## 📌 Use Case

This project can be implemented at busy intersections to automatically:

- Count the number of vehicles per lane.
- Determine which side has **high**, **moderate**, or **low** traffic.
- Allocate green signal time based on real-time traffic volume.
- Help reduce manual intervention and **optimize traffic flow** efficiently.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Input live feed or video.
2. Apply vehicle detection algorithm (YOLO or Haar Cascade).
3. Count vehicles per frame per lane.
4. Analyze which lane has most congestion.
5. Use logic to control traffic lights dynamically.
